An Autonomous Access Gate System that looks for human body parameters such as temperature and spO2 levels to assess if the person shows symptoms of the Corona Virus (Covid19). If the person entering does not show any symptoms then the system checks to see if the person is wearing a face mask. Provided he is wearing one the person is allowed to enter after dispensing some handsanitizer to clean his hands.
